 <body>
<p>We are Main Street Connections, LLC, a company with over twenty years experience in telephone and data communications.We provide access to the latest technology in products and services to help keep you competitive in tomorrow's world.</p>
   
   <h4>Data Cabling</h4>
   <p>Network or Data cables are what keep your business going and communicating. The material, quality, installation and testing of such cabling is critical. Much more so than that of Voice Cabling. This is mainly due to networks of businesses today demanding incredible speeds and transferring large amounts of information. Our educated and certified staff of technicians will make absolutely sure that your new cabling structure will live up to the demand of your networking needs.</p>
 
   <h4>Coax Cabling</h4>
   <p>Coax cables support much higher bandwiths than unshielded twisted pairs (UTP) cables. The best result for coax cable usage is when the transmitter and receiver have matching impedance. The need for such matching is crucial at higher frequencies where impedance mismatches can be severe. Being able to install coax cables and actually knowing how to install this type of cabling are of completely different spectrums. Our certified staff of technicians make sure both transmitter and receiver have identical impedance.</p>
  
   <h4>Wireless Access Points</h4>
   <p>The Server Room is an area in your business that houses your server and patch panels. This is the brains behind your network. In this room there can be several hundred different cables coming into this central location. Or if your server is stored separate from your patch panels tie cables or patch cords will be run from one location to the other. In both locations the structure or the wiring and the appearance of the cabling should be clean. A hallmark of Main Street Connections is that if your company has 10 cables or 2000 cables, all will be structured in a clean and neat appearance. All will be labeled in accordance of the destination of each cable.</p>
   
   <h4>Server Rooms</h4>
    <p>Wireless networking is vastly coming into high demand. With the ever growing usage of laptop PCs in the business and personal the need for wireless network access points is growing. In many businesses today Voice Cabling, Data Cabling, Fiber Optic Cabling, and Wireless Access Points are all used together. Main Street Connections is able to design, install, and configure what ever your business may need.</p>
